Sorting Visualizer
Overview
The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to demonstrate various sorting algorithms through visual representation. Users can generate random arrays, select different sorting algorithms, and watch the sorting process in action. The project provides insights into each algorithm's functionality, time complexity, and space complexity.

Features
Visualize the following sorting algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Adjustable array size using a scrollbar.
Control buttons to generate new arrays, start sorting, and perform fast sorts.
Detailed documentation of each algorithm, including:
Theory
Time complexity
Space complexity
Implementation in Python, Java, C, and C++.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Styling: CSS
Development Tools: Node.js, npm
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SortingVisualizer.git
cd SortingVisualizer
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
Open the application in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).
Use the scrollbar to select the array size.
Click on "Generate New Array" to create a random array.
Choose a sorting algorithm and click "Start Sort" to visualize the sorting process.
Documentation
Each sorting algorithm's theory, time complexity, and implementation are documented on the home page.
